# Fashion Blog

Given some starter code, see if you can recreate the Fashion Blog screenshot below.

This repo contains 3 branches:

- **no-markup-starter** - This version is on the master branch (and is the most challenging). You'll need to add both the HTML and CSS to this starter code.

- **css-starter** - This version contains the HTML structure so you'll only need to focus on adding your CSS rules.

- **solution** - This contains the solution.
